🌍 OpenTravel AI – Destination & Booking Search Engine
📌 Overview

OpenTravel AI is an AI-powered travel search engine that uses scraped open-source travel data (from sources like Wikivoyage, OpenStreetMap, and other free APIs) to provide structured information about destinations worldwide.

Users can:

Search for destinations.

Get structured JSON data about places (with required fields like destination and country).

View images of destinations (scraped and linked from open sources).

Get recommendations for activities (from cheap-but-worthy to premium experiences).

Access direct booking links from open platforms.

The system is designed to grow into a full booking + travel planning platform with AI-powered automation.
